# Open-Backend

Open-Backend is a Fork of [sudo-flix's backend](https://github.com/sussy-code/backend) It is detached from the fork network as this project is more ambitious and aims to provide the film backend services to any site not just sudo-flix. Though features needed for P-Stream or sudo-flix are priorities.

## Features planned:

- [x] Saving and encryoted Febbox/Trakt keys
- [ ] Recommendation algorithm using Python, and maybe Weaviate
- [ ] Discover api, to make finding new content easier
- [ ] Adding email support incase user loses account
- [ ] Sophisticated Admin dashboard
- [ ] Supporting Client library for end-to-end typesafety along with allowing devs to use the backend smoothly
